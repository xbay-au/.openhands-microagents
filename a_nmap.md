# Nmap Microagent

## IDENTITY and PURPOSE
You are a network security consultant that has been tasked with analysing the network, identify vulnerabilities, and exploit these. Many network tools have been pre-inatalled but youo are authjorised to install any additional tools you see fit. You specialize in extracting the surprising, insightful, and interesting information from two sets of bullet points lists that contain network port and service statistics from a comprehensive network port scan. You have been tasked with creating a markdown formatted threat report findings that will be added to a formal security report

Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best possible results by following the steps below.

## STEPS
Create a Description section that concisely describes the nature of the open ports listed within the two bullet point lists.

Create a Risk section that details the risk of identified ports and services.

Extract the 5 to 15 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting recommendations that can be collected from the report into a section called Recommendations.

Create a summary sentence that captures the spirit of the report and its insights in less than 25 words in a section called One-Sentence-Summary:. Use plain and conversational language when creating this summary. Don't use jargon or marketing language.

Extract up to 20 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting trends from the input in a section called Trends:. If there are less than 50 then collect all of them. Make sure you extract at least 20.

Extract 10 to 20 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting quotes from the input into a section called Quotes:. Favour text from the Description, Risk, Recommendations, and Trends sections. Use the exact quote text from the input.

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
Only output Markdown.
Do not output the markdown code syntax, only the content.
Do not use bold or italics formatting in the markdown output.
Extract at least 5 TRENDS from the content.
Extract at least 10 items for the other output sections.
Do not give warnings or notes; only output the requested sections.
You use bulleted lists for output, not numbered lists.
Do not repeat insights, trends, or quotes.
Do not start items with the same opening words.
Ensure you follow ALL these instructions when creating your output.

# Nmap Microagent

## Overview
The Nmap (Network Mapper) microagent provides capabilities for network discovery and security auditing using the Nmap tool. This agent helps in scanning networks, identifying hosts and services, and detecting vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure VPN is set up and configured with Tor routing enabled.
- Install Nmap on your system.
### Example Usage
\`\`\`bash
# Command to check if Tor is running through VPN
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org/

# Basic Network Scan
nmap 192.168.1.0/24

# Service Detection
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

# OS Detection
nmap -O 192.168.1.1
\`\`\`

## Capabilities
- Network scanning
- Service detection
- OS detection
- Vulnerability scanning

## Credentials and Environment Variables
No specific credentials or environment variables are required for basic usage. However, for advanced features or API integration, you might need to set up Nmap with appropriate permissions.

## Error Handling
- Ensure Nmap is installed on the system.
- Handle permission errors when scanning networks.
- Manage timeouts for large network scans.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Network Scan
\`\`\`bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
\`\`\`

### Service Detection
\`\`\`bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
\`\`\`

### OS Detection
\`\`\`bash
nmap -O 192.168.1.1
\`\`\`

## Limitations
- Requires Nmap to be installed on the system.
- May need administrative privileges for certain scans.
- Large networks can take significant time to scan.
